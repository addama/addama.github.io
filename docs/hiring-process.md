# Hiring Process

However you decide to find, interview, and hire new people, it's going to be easier and less stressful for you (and potentially them) to adhere to a system. The system that I use is below, the main gimmicks of which are:

* Job ads are information-dense, honest, and informal
* All applications are put into buckets depending on what state they are in
* Each bucket has a generic pre-written email that gets sent at each stage
* The interview and hiring process is worker-friendly

## Writing the Ad

The job ad is a random person's tiny window into our company and a single role we need filled. Think about all the job postings you may have read throughout your professional career - what did you hate about them? The aim is to create the maximal job ad that the most amount of candidates will respond to.

We do this by being:

* Information-dense
* Honest
* Concise
* Informal

### Information Density

Including every single fact about the role, the company, and its needs allows candidates to more accurately forecast their ability to do the job, and whether they would like to work for you. The more you cram in there, the easier it will be for good and qualified candidates to *know* that they are good and qualified.

It is also common to not include good and useful info just because what's there doesn't feel like it's enough, or not competitive. Even if you "only" have an insurance stipend instead of a company medical insurance plan, you're only doing yourself a disservice by not mentioning every benefit you can provide. 

Common density data points:
* Is this salary or hourly?
* Medical benefits, listed individually
* Is this a supervisory role?
* Will they have to travel?
* Who will they report to?
* What is the salary/hourly range?
* What are the exact technology/language/software reqirements?
* What do we do around here anyway?

### Honesty

Your gut reaction is probably to omit the salary, and keep it a secret until the candidate asks or negotiates. This is a cumbersome, needlessly complicated and frankly outdated way of thinking. We have a budget for their salary, and while we may be able to make small adjustments to that, *it doesn't matter what the candidate wants*. So... why go through that song and dance? Why risk going through the entire interview process only to find that they expect to be paid twice what we offer? More often than not, as with [information density](#information-density), including the salary/hourly range will help candidates evaluate your ad in a positive and constructive way.

Besides, if you feel the need to hide the salary, you're probably paying too low for what you're asking, and you need to reevaluate the role. Or at least that's what your candidates are thinking. 

If the role has needs that are difficult or specific, list them. If this is a grunt role that will be shoveling shit and painting rocks, say that. Be honest. 

### Asking For Only What's Necessary

Ideally, a role would only be required to perform one set of related functions, plus a few optional side-duties. These "pure roles" are easier to hire for, and more attractive to candidates, because there's a clear view of what's required and what the candidate will be judged on.

Take the time to evaluate and itemize exactly what the role will do and what it'll be responsible for. If you find it difficult to express in a simple list, then the role is likely too complicated. Vague or overly complex job ads are like shooting buckshot into the dark: you might hit something, maybe a great many things, but you won't get the result you would have gotten if you had been more patient and used a more powerful weapon.

You may also be tempted to ask for every possible technology and capability possible in this role, hoping to catch a unicorn. **Do not do this.** This is off-putting to perfectly good candidates, and is completely unnecessary to begin with. Most roles will have a short list of basic requirements, and maybe a few great-to-haves. Those great-to-haves should represent things that you will likely need to train them in, but by already knowing that thing, they'll save you time and money. 

Similarly, does this junior role really require a degree? It might be nice, sure, but in what way would it actually be required to perform the duties assigned? The answer: it probably isn't necessary. Make that obvious. Using a degree as "proof" of success and quality is an outdated way of thinking, and will only work if the degree in question delivers the exact skills you need. Always, always, always equate a degree with years-in-role. Programmers, for example, can learn their entire industry and be extremely qualified and successful without stepping foot in a college. If you hire a programmer right out of college simply because they have a degree where another didn't, *you are bad at your job*. Simple. Project Managers, however, require a specific skillset that is best taught in schools (or an equivalent amount of years doing the work in a progressively increasing role).

Remember the maxim: *Perfect is the enemy of good!*

### Being Informal

At the end of the day, this stuff isn't that serious. We are not a faceless corporate entity with every metric tracked and reported on - we have a culture, a personality. There's a person out there who would love to work with us, and we'd love to work with them. That's all it has to be.

Obviously, we don't want to be throwing slang around and being unprofessional, but candidates will resonate more with a posting that is written like a person wrote it, not some automated report spat out based on a database query.

Don't be afraid to make jokes, get cheeky, simplify the language, etc. As long as your information density and honesty are not affected (and you don't go overboard), that can only add to the authenticity of the listing. 

### Putting It All Together

If you have done your job well, you should have a job ad that is dense with information, has concise requirements that are specific to the role and attainable by the average person, and looks like it was written by a human rather than a robot or a committee. 

Consider this example, which (hopefully) embodies all of these points:

> **Xtract Solutions** is looking for a **Junior Frontend Developer** specializing in React with Redux to join the team. Xtract Solutions is a software company that leads the market in innovative solutions in the allergy immunotherapy field.
> 
> Your primary duties will be to work in a small team to learn an existing codebase (React, Redux, Saga) and to create new web applications within it that will address specific needs in allergy immunotherapy clinics. You'll start work on our latest release as soon as you're comfortable with our environment.
> 
> * Learn our React/Redux/Saga setup to create web applications that talk to a PHP backend for use in a clinical environment
> * Write testable, efficient, readable code
> * Participate in Agile/Scrum development process, actively looking for company, team, and personal improvement
> * Bring your individual skills, interests, and experiences to bear in this merit-based company
> * Build efficiently and conservatively, solving problems quickly with what you have whenever possible
> * Maintain the security of HIPAA data across multiple client databases
> 
> This is one of two roles; both are primarily React developers, but one will have a side-focus on network and implementation work (AWS, Chef, Active Directory, etc), and the other on QA and automated testing (Procedural testing, Cypress, PHPUnit). If you have interest, passion, and (importantly) experience in either or both of these, please let us know. But don't worry - as long as you can handle the React/Redux/Node part, we'll help you learn the rest.

## Filtering and Stratifying Candidates

Once the ad has been posted and you start getting candidates in, it's important to stay on top of them before they overwhelm you. Use Gmail labels or some other organization system to keep track of who is in what status, what emails you've sent, etc.

While I have provided *my* generic emails [in the appendix below](#appendix-a-example-emails), I highly encourage you to word them in your own voice so that it feels more personal. Two of the things that candidates appreciate most when job-hunting are:

* Responsiveness
* Feeling like they were actually considered, not just filtered by a robot

The procedure outlined below attempts to address both of those things, while not placing too much burden on the hiring team by streamlining the process.

### Procedure

1. Is their resume unopenable?
   1. Send the [Bad Resume](#bad-resume) email
      * If you get a good resume back, thank them and move forward
1. Are they remote or is their location a mystery/questionable?
   1. Send [Bad Location](#bad-location) email
      * If they offer to relocate, send the [No Relocation](#no-relocation) email and STOP.
      * If they are in fact local, thank them and move forward.	  
1. Send the [Accepted](#accepted) email
1. Have all of your candidates received an email and responded appropriately?
   * Assemble a hiring team that will review and eventually interview candidates
   * Stratify your Accepted candidates into groups based on how qualified they are and your personal intuition
   * Agree on an interview agenda (agenda, not script) based on the role, the company's other needs, and the individual candidate's qualifications/deficiencies
1. Schedule interviews in groups, placing the most likely/effective candidates first
   * Send the [Schedule Interview](#schedule-interview) email to candidates in the group
   * Only schedule new interviews when an entire stratification group has been interviewed and you still have open slots
1. Conduct ALL desired/needed interviews
1. Do you have candidates that you would like to hire and work with?
   * Send the [Offer](#offer) email(s)
1. Have all your offers been accepted, thereby filling your slots?
   * Send the [Hired](#hired) email to your new coworkers
   * Send the [Not selected](#not-selected) email to everyone else, including those that never responded to the *Bad Location* and *Bad Resume* emails. The *No Relocation* email recipients have already been rejected, so they don't need this one. If the candidate needed feedback after the interview, or could use some advice to progress their career, this is the email to do that in. Be sure to keep it positive and constructive
   * *Exit the process*
1. Have none of the candidates panned out?
   * Re-list the ad, and advertize in one more location/site/service, or a different service entirely depending on results. Just know that you will get more applicants if you wait before re-listing
1. Are rejected candidates still arguing for their candidacy even though you have notified them of their rejection?
   * Ignore them. You did your duty, and it is unprofessional on their part to pursue a dead-end instead of moving on
   * Obviously if they are asking for feedback or being otherwise constructive, it's in our/their best interest to help them out if you are able

## Conducting the Interview

Interviewing is an art unto itself, and is a skill that you develop through repetition. Below are some pointers to keep your interview smooth and informative.

* **Determine ahead of time what you need to get out of the candidate to decide if they're worthy.** There's nothing worse then finishing an interview only to realize you never actually found out if they know how to do the specific things you need. Build your questions and activities around hitting as many of your needs/questions about their fitness for the role as possible
* **Have two interviewers** (max three, but not more). Each person can play off what the other is saying to keep the conversation rolling and fill dead air. If you can, try to get two people that will have a direct impact on the candidate's daily work
* **Do not schedule meetings over food** unless it's the only time/way it's possible. Being in a public setting reduces a candidate's likelihood to be honest and open (fearing that strangers will hear and judge). Being in a restaurant setting introduces too many complications to count, to include noise levels, food/diet restrictions and judgements based on them, the cost and who pays, etc. The *only exception* would be for sales people, who will often be in these settings, or in the very least need to be able to handle social situations like this without being off-putting
* **Keep it casual!** Stressing the candidate out with formality and pressure will affect the quality of responses you get back, often in negative ways
* **Unless they are factually wrong or inappropriate, accept everything the candidate says.** You can grill them a little bit by asking probing questions, but the point is not to determine if they're capable of being 100% factually correct 100% of the time. Let them mess up, let them hang themselves, let them correct themselves if they feel the need to
* **Address anything inappropriate or unprofessional immediately and constructively.** Inform them that "just so you know, that's not an appropriate thing to say, especially in an interview setting." This is usually all that is required to address things like this
* **Work on your rhetoric!** Find ways to relate to the candidate, to share stories that echo or contrast what they're trying to say. This builds rapport and eases the stress, which leads to more honest responses
* **Remember this phrase: *the company agrees with itself.*** Your interviewers (representing the company) should share a common stance, a common understanding of the role, the company, and how the interview should go. Present a unified face for the company, and discuss/fix your differences afterward
* **Look for opportunities to educate or help the candidate.** Especially for junior positions, or in times when it's obvious that they're missing some crucial bit of knowledge or experience, it costs you nothing to quickly give them that info, and it makes you/us look good
* **Don't be afraid to end the meeting early.** The candidate doesn't know how long the interview was scheduled for. Sitting around rambling or continuing to talk to someone you have no interest in hiring is not a good use of your (or their) time. Just be sure to end it naturally and positively. "Well, that's all we had - did you have any more questions for us?"
* **Start the interview by establishing the company and the candidate.** Summarize the company, what it does, and a little of its history, as well as a summary of the role. Ask the candidate to do the same for themselves. Ask them why they're interested in the role, and, if feasible, provide the reason(s) *you* were interested in interviewing them. This sets a base set of knowledge that can be built upon, and you can immediately address any misunderstandings
* **Avoid promises or implications!** Never give the candidate the impression that they're your #1 pick, or that this interview is just a formality, or that their pay is set in stone, or that they're the only candidate, etc. A candidate is a candidate, just the same as any other candidate, until they're hired. Nothing is set in stone, and there are so many more people to interview
* **You can discuss pay, but don't negotiate for it yet.** The initial interview is not the place to negotiate pay - we don't even know if we want to hire you yet. Pay and other benefits get its own stage in the hiring process and may or may not even include the initial interviewers

### Useful Interview Questions and Topics

* Summarize the company and its history
* Explain the role, why it exists, what need it's filling
* Have the candidate summarize their work history
* Ensure them that this is a casual process and we're not looking to be impressed
* Did you have any trouble getting here/finding us?
* What attracted you to the role?
* Do you have any projects that you were particularly proud of?
* What do you do outside of work?
* Do you have any concerns about the role?
* Do you have any questions for us?
* I noticed in your resume that you mentioned ____, can you explain that for me?
* This role is focused on _____, could you give some examples of your work with that?
* Have you ever had to work with someone you just didn't get along with? How did you handle that?
* Do you prefer to work alone, or in a group?
* What level of supervision do you prefer? Daily checkups to keep you in line, or would you prefer to be left alone and course corrected as needed?
* Do you see yourself in management some day?
* Where do you want to be professionally next year?

## Making an Offer

Once you have conducted enough interviews to satisfactorily fill all your open slots, you are now ready to make an offer. The interview process is not complete until ALL of your slots are filled by people who have accepted your offers. Only once that is the case can you start sending [Not Selected](#not-selected) emails to the remaining candidates.

You offer should be in writing, using the same email/system you have been talking to them on, and must include the following things in simple, unambiguous terms:

* An acknowledgement of how well they did in the interviews
* A statement saying that we are offering them a position, including the position title 
* The proposed salary
* A list of benefits they will receive
* An invitation to schedule in-person negotiations if they want to

Keep it simple and to the point. Give them the opportunity to negotiate if they want - implying in any way that there can be no negotiation is not worker-friendly and makes us look scummy. This is also why the offer is done in writing. This ensures that the candidate has an opportunity to read and process the offer before giving a yes or no, as well as avoiding awkward moments of "I am actually waiting on another offer (that might be better) right now, can I call you back in a few days?" 

If the candidate(s) accept, you can then start sending your rejection emails. If you now want to call or email your new coworkers, this would be a great time to do it, as you are now out of the process. Ensure that you schedule a first day that is shorter than a normal day, and that they know what the expected dress code (or lack thereof) is.

# Appendix A: Example Emails

## Bad Resume

> Hello,
>
> Thank you for your interest in the Junior Frontend Developer position here at Xtract Solutions! It seems like the resume you submitted wasn't encoded properly, and neither I nor Indeed could open it. Would you mind double checking your copy and replying to this email with a new copy and/or a different format? 

## Bad Location

> Hello,
>
> Thank you for your interest in the Junior Frontend Developer position here at Xtract Solutions! Unfortunately, it looks like your location is not local to us in Beaverton, OR, and we can't currently support remote work. Sorry about that; I know it's the dream. If you are local to Beaverton, please let me know and potentially update your resume/website/indeed to include your correct location for future applications.

## No Relocation

> Hello,
>
> While we really do appreciate your willingness to relocate, we have a strict policy not to hire anyone pending a move - in our experience that move either never happens, or too greatly affects the candidate's life and therefore their work. That's not good for you or your career, even though your dedication to the job search is admirable. 
> 
> From one developer to another, I wish you the best of luck!

## Accepted

> Hello,
> 
> Thank you for your interest in the Junior Frontend Developer position here at Xtract Solutions! I just wanted to let you know that I have received your application, and will be getting back to you soon (depending on applicant volume) with an answer either way. 
> 
> If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, don't hesitate to ask!

## Schedule Interview

> Hello,
>
> Xtract Solutions would like to invite you to the office to interview for the Junior Frontend Developer position, if you're still interested. The Lead Developer and I were very impressed with your resume, and think you're potentially a great fit! 
>
> Please look over these day/time slots, and let me know if any (or none) of these work:
>
> * Monday, February 31st at 0900
> * Day, Month Day at Hour
> * Day, Month Day at Hour
> 
> Our address is: 
> 9954 SW Arctic Dr
> Beaverton, OR 97005
> 
> If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know!

## Offer

> Hello,
> 
> We were very impressed with your application and interview, and would like to offer you the position of Junior Frontend Developer here at Xtract Solutions! 
> 
> We would like to offer you a salary of $?0,000 per year, though please feel free to schedule a time to come in and negotiate. As a reminder, our benefits include medical and dental insurance, PTO, a flexible schedule, and a training budget.
> 
> Excited to hear back from you!

## Hired

The *Hired* email should feature the phrase "Welcome to Xtract Solutions," as well as deliver a start date, if one is known, as well as any information about paperwork that is known at the time of the email. Write everything that you have available down so that it is all in writing: Your start date will be *this*, you'll sign the following paperwork, etc. 

As the format of this email is highly dependant on the information available to you when you send it, this will have to be hand-written.

## Not Selected

> Hello,
>
> Unfortunately, you were not selected for the Junior Frontend Developer position here at Xtract Solutions. Let me tell you, when you're hiring for such a dense and often competitive field, it's really (really) hard to try and make sense of all the faces and qualities and qualifications, let alone pick the one or two that best match the job. It's an ordeal, trust me; the spreadsheet I built alone would drive a person mad. Next time, it could be you, and I hope you apply for future Xtract Solutions posts. Best of luck, from one developer to another.

# Appendix B: Interview Questions

## The Problem Solving Gauntlet

The following question puts the candidate into a hypothetical impossible situation to determine how they think through problems, and what avenues they have/use to solve them. Essentially the scheme is that they are working on something and it doesn't work - nomatter what they do, even if that would normally be a solid choice. The outcome never changes: it doesn't work. 

It's important to acknowledge that this is an impossible, wacky situation, and to persist through the questioning until the candidate can no longer constructively answer. After this, you can shore up any resources they might have missed (did they never mention googling it?). 

Additionally, if they are eager to impress, they may never mention when they would give up and move on to other tasks. This is an important part of the job, as time management may dictate moving on to more important work. They need to know that that is a thing that will be expected of them.

This is generally written for a developer, but it wouldn't be too hard to express it for any role as long as you adapt your problem-solving expectations to what that role has available to it.

> **Interviewer:** So here's a hypothetical situation - you're working on something, maybe a component or a function, you go to run it and it doesn't work. What do you do?

> **Candidate:** I check the documentation...

> **Interviewer:** Alright, you do that, and it still doesn't work - what now?

> **Candidate:** I try to add in error handling/logs/whatever...

> **Interviewer:** That doesn't work either.

> **Candidate:** I google it/look on stackoverflow...

> **Interviewer:** There is nothing. No one in the history of the internet has had your problem. Again, this is a wacky situation that's not realistic, but here we are. What now?

> **Candidate:** I would ask someone for help...

> **Interviewer: *to co-interviewer, who is in on the scheme*:** Hey have you ever seen this? And even if you have, do you even have time to help right now? Nope, looks like you're on your own.

> **Candidate:** I rewrite the whole thing...

> **Interviewer:** Even after rewriting, it does not work.

*And so on*

What we're looking for:
* That they are familiar with the full range of problem solving utilities available to them, which includes:
  * Google, generically
  * Stack Overflow, specifically
  * Coworkers/experts
  * Any documentation that might exist
  * Any forums/Github wiki/issues for what they're working with
  * Sometimes you just typed things wrong
  * Sometimes you just have to rewrite the whole thing
  * Sometimes you just have to move on
* That they express some concern over their time management, eventually leading to giving up on the impossible task
* That they don't give up too early, especially before the obvious solutions like googling or asking for help
* Minorly, that they are able to work in a hypothetical technical situation without becoming confused

## Culture Questions

Never underestimate the power and utility of innocuous personal questions. They can help put your candidate at ease, and can often be a jumping off point for further questions. This is where a strong sense of rhetoric can come in handy so that you can keep the conversation going even if they are uncertain of how to answer or get too far off-topic. Additionally, they can be used (as long as you don't read into it too much...) to assess subtle personality quirks.

Generic, open-ended questions are good, and are best asked either at the beginning or end of the interview session. Industry-specific preference questions, especially divisive ones, are also good as they are relevant to the profession, but still warrant a personal answer.

Questions to consider:
* Are you a Mac or PC person?
* What text editor/IDE do you use?
* What kind of music do you listen to?
* Do you have any plans for the weekend?
* Asking them about something that has recently come up in the office as a point of conversation
* If you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be?

Questions to avoid:
* Yes or no questions
  * Unless used as a lead-up to a more involved open-ended question
* Any questions involving sex, politics, drugs, or religion - even tangentially
* Any question that pre-supposes or asks about marital/relationship status, wealth, or children

What we're looking for:
* A sense of their personality, and especially anything that would clash with existing employees
* For the candidate to loosen up a bit and understand that the interview is casual and conversational
* Their comfort level with industry-specific topics, or topics of conversation that will inevitably come up while on the job

## Process Questions

One of the best ways to get a candidate talking (usually) is to ask them how they went about something, the process they went through to do something in their past. This is especially insightful for their portfolio/resume projects that they are proud of, as they'll usually have some story or anecdote or issue that came up.

* Your ____ client website looks great - what was the process for making that?
* I noticed you had ____ in your Github - what was the inspiration for that, and what was the process for developing it?
* So you were a chef before - what inspired you to pursue development, and what steps did you take to get here?
