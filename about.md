# About

This portfolio collects samples of my writing across several categories and purposes, and presents them as a record of my ability to write effective, memorable, and deep documentation, technical instruction, and other types of writing.

Much of my writing experience has been in documenting processes and policy in a technical environment, though I have experience in creative, transactional, and technical writing as well.

I have attempted to collect any non-proprietary writings here, though as a designer and holistic creator, some of my writing is intrinsically tied to its form and presentation and can't be displayed here. That's unfortunate for me, because I feel the junction of design and writing is where I do my best work. 

# Writing Strategy

I have developed a writing strategy over decades that emphasizes the following:

* **Writing for the audience, not the topic.** My goal is to deliver information to the audience in a way that matters to them as opposed to "doing the topic justice" or exploring all aspects of it
* **Being as consistent as possible across all documents.** Using consistent wording, epithet, comparisons, structure, contractions, and style across all documents marks me as the author, selfishly, but also primes the reader that is familiar with my writing to better receive the topic.
* **Writing for posterity.** In writing technical or process documentation, I write with the expectation that what I write will potentially stand forever. As such, I purposefully avoid specifics, names, dates/times, slang, etc, that would invalidate the content in the eyes of the reader.
* **Using fantastical, dramatic, or empowering rhetoric where appropriate, but sparingly.** I believe that using dramatic language, anecdotes, metaphor, and other bold statements and arguments occasionally has the effect of making writing, particularly bland technical writing, more memorable and relatable. 
* **Construct or address the *we* of the topic.** Being a part of a *we*, an in-group, makes processes and technologies more personal. Creating this inclusion where it may not exist is a technique I use to increase the power behind the writing as well as to engage the reader subconsciously.
