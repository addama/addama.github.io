# Allergy Immunotherapy Primer

Allergy Immunotherapy is the process in which allergens are periodically injected (or absorbed) into the patient to immunize (“desensitize”) the patient to the allergens. There are two main methods for allergy immunotherapy: Subcutaneous Immunotherapy (SCIT, aka “shots” or “allergy shots”) and Sublingual Immunotherapy (SLIT, aka “drops”).

Both methods require mixing of allergen extracts, from a prescription, into an individual patient vial.  The contents and dosage of each extract are customized and specific to that individual patient in the treatment vial. The patient is then periodically injected with a small amount of extract from their patient vial, slowing increasing the dosage over time, to immunize the patient.

Of practicing physicians there are two main competing camps: Board Certified Allergists (BCA) and ENTs (Otolaryngologists or “Ear Nose Throat” doctors). There is also a much smaller segment of primary care doctors that do allergy immunotherapy. Allergists and ENTs have two similar but distinct methods for treating patients with SCIT shots.

## Allergy Testing

Before the patient is treated with allergy immunotherapy SCIT or SLIT they must first be tested for individual allergens to discover the patient relative sensitivity to each specific allergen and to verify they are a good candidate for immunotherapy. This is done by following one of several different protocols.

### Prick Testing

The patient is pricked with the various allergens, generally on the arm or back in a grid pattern. A specially designed pricking device is dipped into a well of allergen extract and is pressed into the skin. This draws a small amount of extract into the layers of skin and will initiate an immune response in the skin. 

The larger the reaction, the more sensitive a patient is to that extract. The white lump (Wheal) generated around the prick site is measured and recorded along with the surrounding red inflammation (flare). The size of these two reactions is used to determine if starting strength of the extract used in immunotherapy, or if the reaction is small to exclude the extract.

### Intradermal (ID) Testing

Intradermal skin tests are very similar to prick tests, the main difference being a small amount of extract (0.01 mL) is injected under the skin via a syringe. ID testing is sometimes used after a weak response to the prick test in order to find a more accurate sensitivity diagnostic.

### RAST (Blood) Testing

RAST testing is done via a blood sample and sent to a lab for analysis. The RAST test is able to determine a patient's sensitivity to allergens by examining the blood’s antibody response to allergens. RAST testing is the least effective testing and is generally only done for patients that are not good candidates for skin testing due to other conditions. 

### MQT Testing

Modified Quantitative Test (MQT) is a testing protocol method used by ENTs. It is a combination of prick and intradermal testing. A prick test is performed and the size of the reaction is used to determine start concentration for each extract for medium to large reactions, or if the reaction is small an additional intradermal test will be performed for that extract. The intradermal results can either be negative (extract will not be treated) or if positive the patient is only slightly allergic and will start at a higher concentration of that extract.

## Formulating the Prescription

After the completion of the skin test, the physician will review the results and formulate a prescription for the patient if the patient is a good candidate for (and has agreed to) immunotherapy. The prescription will generally include:

 * Which extracts to include in the vial(s)
 * The relative amounts of each extract (dosage)
 * Type and amount of diluent and preservatives
 * Number of dilutions in treatment set (BCA method) OR starting dilution for each extract (ENT method)

## Allergy Immunotherapy Mixing Techniques (SCIT)

Regardless of the method used, the end result is the same: extracts of relative doses or concentrations are mixed together into a patient vial for injection. Patients are started at very dilute level of extracts and build up to concentrated extracts over time. This is known as the “build-up phase”. Once a patient has built-up through all dilutions as it receiving injections from the most concentrate vial the patient is said to be “on maintenance”. 

### The BCA Method

Allergists generally mix a patient vial from all concentrate extracts (“top vial” or “maintenance vial”), then dilute it down into subsequent 10-fold dilutions vials, producing a treatment set or series of vials. Because of the more dilute extract, and therefore more dilute preservatives, the more dilute treatment vials outdate sooner than less dilute vials and the constituent extracts.

Concentration (v/v) | Dilution | Vial Cap Color | Bottle Number | Outdate
--------------------|----------|----------------|---------------|--------
1:1 | Maintenance | Red | 1 | 12 Months
1:10 | 10 Fold | Yellow | 2 | 12 Months
1:100 | 100 Fold | Blue | 3 | 6 Months
1:1000 | 1000 Fold | Green | 4 | 3 Months
1:10,000 | 10,000 Fold | Silver | 5 | 3 Months

### ENT Method

The ENT method of mixing patient vials varies from the BCA method in that ENTs will pre-dilute the extract concentrates into a extract treatment board. Each extract has 6 dilutions from the concentrate, generally of 5-fold dilutions (1:5, 1:25, 1:125 v/v…). ENTs require very large mixing areas to store and layout their mixing area as each extract has a total of seven vials which patient vials are mixed (concentrate plus 6 dilutions). 

Where BCAs will make a treatment set consisting of 5 or more vials (maintenance + build-up dilutions), ENTs only make a single patient vial at a time. During build-up phase of treatment the patient vial will have to be remade often, incrementing the dilution of the constituent extracts each time.

## The Injection Schedule (SCIT)

Regardless of mixing method, the patient will begin treatment on the least concentrated vial and will build-up to the most concentrated vial. With a standard schedule injections occur every 2-10 days. Injections are intramuscular typically in the upper arm. Full treatment is typically 3-5 years.

The first injection is a small volume of extract (0.05 mL) from the least concentrated vial. Subsequent injections will be of larger volume from the same vial, building through to 0.50 mL typically, after which time the next concentrated vial will be started. The next concentrated vial will again start at 0.05 mL and build through to 0.50 mL. This is repeated until the patient is receiving 0.50 mL injections from the maintenance vial.

![Image showing how dose concentrations are built up through the vials over time](/images/2019-10-15-Allergy-Immunotherapy-Primer/image4.png?style=center)

A typical BCA standard build-up schedule is shown above. Clinics will have some variability in dosage and frequency, but will generally follow this basic format. 

ENTs will follow a similar format but do not have colored vial caps to differentiate the dilutions. ENTs only make one vial at a time mixed from various dilutions of the stock extracts. When the bottle is empty they will need to mix the next concentration from the diluted extracts, incrementing the dilution of each extract to the next more concentrated vial as shown below.

Extract | Vial 1 | Vial 2 | Vial 3 | Vial 4 | ... | Vial N
--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----|-------
**Molds** | #6 | #5 | #4 | #3 | ... | #C
**Trees** | #4 | #3 | #2 | #1 | ... | #C
**Grass** | #3 | #2 | #1 | #C | ... | #C

Vials are continually remade until all constituents are the concentrate dilution (#C). The dosage and schedule is otherwise similar to the BCA method.

### Rush and Cluster Schedules

Some physicians have Rush or Cluster immunotherapy schedules. These are highly compressed injection schedules that accomplish many injections in a single day.

For Rush typically a patient can be built-up through the blue vial (or until a local reaction stops progression) in a single day. Injections are given in progressing doses every 30 minutes. This benefits the patient by getting through many months of the build-up phase in a single visit and allows the patient to gain therapeutic value much more quickly.

Cluster immunotherapy is a similar concept but does not require the patient to remain in the clinic all day. Patients are given “clusters” of 2-3 injections spaced 30 minutes apart every 1-2 weeks.

### Maintenance

Once a patient has built-up through to the red vial, the patient will need to continue receiving injections from the maintenance vial for several years. This is called the “maintenance dose” where the patient is said to be “on maintenance”. When the maintenance vial is depleted it will need to be remade before the next injection.

Because the constituent extracts for a maintenance vial could come from different lots, and there is great variability in potency between lots of extracts (called a “hot lot”), typically the maintenance dose is backed off a bit when starting a new maintenance vial and it built-up again through subsequent injections. Sometimes an ID skin test with the new vial is also performed when a starting a new maintenance vial.

## Risks of Immunotherapy

Immunotherapy is not without risk to the patient. Since the physician is injecting a known allergen into the patient's body there is risk for adverse reaction. Reactions can be local (at injection site) or systemic (whole body). Deaths, although rare, do occur.

### Common Mistakes that Lead to Reactions:

 * Injecting the patient with the wrong dosage
 * Injecting the patient from the wrong vial (wrong dilution or different patient’s vial)
 * Adding the wrong amount of an extract into the patient vial set during mixing
 * Adding the wrong type of extract into the patient vial set
 * Leaving out an extract during mixing in patient build-up set and included in subsequent maintenance vial
 * Not accounting for extract potency variability between lots and manufacturers
